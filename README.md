SyR-e is a Matlab/Octave code developed to design synchronous reluctance machines with finite element analysis and the aid of multi-objective optimization algorithms.
It requires Matlab/Octave and FEMM software installed. The recommended FEMM version is 4.2, released on November 15 2013.
The Matlab/Octave scripts realize a parameterised drawing of a synchronous reluctance machine as a .fem file that is analysed by FEMM software. After finite element analysis (FEA) of the machine, the main results are passed to Matlab/Octave. This is used both during design optimization with the aid of a multi-objective optimization algorithm and for machine detailed analysis in post-processing stage.

Features
Automated design of synchronous reluctance machines
Multi-objective differential evolution
FEMM and XFEMM support
Compatible with Matlab/Octave language
Parallel computing on multi-core PC
Cross-platform (Win/Linux) capabilities
